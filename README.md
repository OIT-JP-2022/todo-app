# todo-app

A simple TUI todo app.
Has nested lists. Can read all files from directory and edit the files.

To compile, run: `make todo`

To run specify folder/directory you wish to work with: './todo <directory name>'

Be sure to have your compiler (LLVM) set to the latest C++ version, and be sure that "make" is calling LLVM and not GCC.
